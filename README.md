# ðŸŒ¾ Solving Market Access and Price Exploitation Problems Faced by Indian Farmers Using AI and Data Science

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Study

The main purpose of this research is to highlight the market challenges faced by Indian farmersâ€”especially how they are often unable to get fair prices for their crops even after all their hard work.

We wanted to explore why these problems still exist in 2025 and how technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used not just for innovation, but to solve real-life issues. Instead of choosing crop prediction or irrigation as many do, we focused on market access because this is where most small and marginal farmers silently suffer the most.

They donâ€™t get updated price information, are heavily dependent on middlemen, and often donâ€™t have any direct link to trustworthy buyers. This makes them financially unstable, and sadly, in some cases, this leads to debt and even suicide.

Through this research, weâ€™re trying to come up with practical, inclusive solutions that could genuinely help farmers earn fairly and live with dignity.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

This research explores one of the most pressing yet overlooked issues in Indian agriculture â€” the lack of fair market access and price transparency for small and marginal farmers.

Despite government schemes and digital platforms, many farmers are still exploited by middlemen, lack access to real-time market prices, and often face extreme financial stress. Some of these issues even lead to tragic cases of farmer suicides, especially in regions like Marathwada, Maharashtra.

Our project analyzes these problems using real data from 2025 and explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science can help farmers by providing:

- Hyperlocal price prediction models  
- Voice-enabled, regional-language interfaces  
- Financial planning tools  
- Offline or low-data AI access  
- Direct market linkage to buyers

## ðŸ’¡ Why We Chose This Topic
While there were many topic options like mobile app development, e-commerce analytics, or AI-based customer reviews, we wanted to do something with real-world impact. Something that actually makes a difference in peopleâ€™s lives.

This topic felt deeply important to us. Farmer distress is not just a news headline â€” itâ€™s a reality that still affects thousands of families. Despite government schemes and digital India missions, the smallest and most essential community â€” our farmers â€” still lack access to fair markets.

By choosing this topic, we were able to:

Use our technical skills for a meaningful cause

Learn how to work with real-life datasets and local issues

Propose something that goes beyond theory â€” and could work in the real world
